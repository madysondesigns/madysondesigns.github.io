## Case study content

Add all the details about a project to create a case study.

Style guide:
* Description blurb in frontmatter will show up as a TL;DR section at the top of the page
* Use `h2` for section headers, see outline below
* Use `h3` and `h4` for content subheaders as needed
* Use `h5` to call out short, important blocks of content
* Use `bold` to highlight text or lead in to lists

Image helper:
```
{% include figure.html src="foo.png"
    caption="Caption that appears under image"
    alt="Accessibility alt text" %}
```
