#### I’m looking for an opportunity where I can help figure out what design and user experience means to an organization, its products, and its team.

I'm a designer, a problem solver, a collaborator, and a leader. Let's work together.

## What I Do

I'm most recently at Flatiron Health, where I helped to improve the patient and oncologist experience as well as the designer and developer experience. I worked on our Electronic Health Record platform and its corresponding patient-facing health portal to build features that brought patients and oncologists closer together and improve collaboration practice-wide. I also founded our Design Systems team and focused on product evangelism, design strategy, scaling, and hiring.

Before that I was at Fundera, where I worked on the first digital finance platform for 20k new business owners. I led design for a cross-functional team tasked with pioneering user conversion at the same time as doubling revenue for new product markets.

Further back I was at Betterment, where I helped to design and build a better financial experience from the ground up. I’ve helped the team grow from 12 to over 200, and contributed to growing customers from 10,000 to over 250,000.

All along the way, I've done consulting work in UX, design, and branding for clients in healthcare, tech, and small business.

## What Drives Me

### Solving Problems

I'm curious, ambitious, and passionate. I'm all about diving in head first to a tough challenge, and learning everything I can to help me come up with a solution.

### Collaboration

I believe that people working together can change the world. I want to build teams where people can contribute and learn from each other with passion and respect.

### Missions That Matter

I want to work with people who have seen a real problem and are motivated to fix it. I know that technology can help build a better future for both a product's people and the world.

### Diversity

Diverse groups are more innovative and create a culture that is more productive and inclusive. I'm constantly working to build teams where different voices can build better products.

### Delight

People who are happy and having fun do better work. Users who enjoy their experience are loyal and have trust in the product. I love finding and creating those moments of joy.
